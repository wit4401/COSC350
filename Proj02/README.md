# Project #2: Compressing and Uncompressing Files
## Objective
In this project you are going to implement a compression program and an uncompression
program to build a useful compression utility. These are separate programs, but they share many
functions, which should be built as shared library. The program that reads a regular file and
produces a compressed file is called the compression or huffing program. The program that does
the reverse, producing a regular file from a compressed file is called the uncompression or
unhuffing program.
