# Task 1
###  Write your own mv named MyMv By using bash command mv, you can move a file from current directory to another directory. Write your own mv called MyMv by using system calls link() and unlink(). Your program named MyMv can move a file from a current directory to a directory. Your program receives two arguments: file name and path to a directory where the file need to move, or file name and path to directory with a file name. If the second argument is a directory, move a file to the directory. If the second argument is not a directory, move file to directory as a file name.
### <em>This is a reapt of task 5 in lab 4 since our time to complete it was extended. See lab 4 for the program.</em>
# Task 2
### Open the utmp file
#### a. Write a function named openUtmpFile that opens the utmp file and returns its file descriptor. If the file can't be opened, the function writes an error message and exits (thereby terminating the program). 
#### b. Call openUtmpFile in the main function. Compile your program to check for errors.
# Task 3
